## Technical Implementation Details

### Accessibility Features
```typescript
// Reduced motion detection
const [reducedMotion, setReducedMotion] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
  setReducedMotion(mediaQuery.matches);
}, []);

// ARIA live announcements
const announceToScreenReader = useCallback((message: string) => {
  const announcement = document.createElement('div');
  announcement.setAttribute('aria-live', 'polite');
  announcement.textContent = message;
  document.body.appendChild(announcement);
}, []);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Enhanced performance tracking
const usePerformanceMonitor = (options) => {
  // Track render time and memory usage
  // Log slow renders and memory leaks
  // Provide actionable performance insights
};
```

### SEO Optimization
```typescript
// Dynamic meta tag management
const updateMetaTag = (name: string, content: string) => {
  let meta = document.querySelector(`meta[name="${name}"]`);
  if (!meta) {
    meta = document.createElement('meta');
    meta.setAttribute('name', name);
    document.head.appendChild(meta);
  }
  meta.content = content;
};
```
